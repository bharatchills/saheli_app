# saheli_app

## Introduction
Saheli is an idea for a mobile application that aims to provide a safe and secure platform for women to travel together, especially during late hours. The application aims to provide a sense of safety and security to women who travel alone at night by connecting them with other women who are traveling in the same direction.

## Features
- Saheli will have the following features:
- User Registration: Women can create their profiles and sign up for the app using their email or social media accounts.
- Geolocation: The app will use the user's location to find other women who are traveling in the same direction.
- Matching System: The app will match users based on their travel routes and timings to provide the best possible match.
- In-app Chat: Users can communicate with each other using an in-app chat feature to coordinate their travel plans.
- Reviews and Ratings: Users will have the option to rate their travel companions after the journey to ensure the safety of the community.

## How it works
- Users sign up for the app and create their profiles.
- The app will ask for the user's travel route and timing.
- The app will match the user with other women traveling in the same direction.
- Users can chat with their travel companions to coordinate their travel plans.
